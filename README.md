## ðŸšŒ Smart Bus Control & Fare Automation System

The **Smart Bus Control & Fare Automation System** is designed to improve urban transportation by integrating **NFC technology**, **GPS tracking**, and **automated fare calculation**.  
Passengers scan NFC cards when entering and exiting the bus, and the system automatically calculates the **travel distance** and **fare** using GPS coordinates and the **Haversine formula**.

### ðŸ”§ Key Features
- NFC-based passenger identification  
- GPS-enabled route tracking  
- Automatic distance and fare calculation  
- Real-time monitoring of bus movement  
- Reduced manual errors and faster transactions  

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To create a **smart, transparent, and efficient** public transport system that minimizes traffic issues, ensures fair fares, and supports better city traffic management.
